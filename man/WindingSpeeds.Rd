\description{
In a completely randomized design to study the effect of the speed of winding
thread (1: slow; 2: normal; 3: fast; 4: maximum) onto 75-yard spools, 16 runs of 10,000 spools
each were made at each of the four winding speeds. The response variable is the number of
thread breaks during, the production run.
